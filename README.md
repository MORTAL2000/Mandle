## Mandle

Mandlebrot implementations in MPI/OpenMP and OpenCL. This is more a benchmark between different implementations and strategies to solve a problem in a concurrent manner.

# Building

To build all implementations just run the build file

    $ ./build.sh

If you would like to build it on your own just have a look at the bash file.

# Usage

To run any of the provided implementations use one the provided scripts:

    ./run_mandle_[Implementation].sh

For available CLI options have a look into the test scripts: run_mandle_test.sh and run_mandle_test_cl.sh
